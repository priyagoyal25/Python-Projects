    "# IP Webcam Image Viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to view and capture images from an IP webcam. It uses the Tkinter library for the GUI, OpenCV for image processing, and requests to fetch images from the IP webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `PIL` (Pillow): Used for handling images.\n",
    "- `tkinter`: Used for creating the GUI.\n",
    "- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the IP webcam.\n",
    "- `cv2` (OpenCV): Used for image processing.\n",
    "- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations on image data.\n",
    "- `imutils`: Used for resizing images.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these libraries using `pip` if you don't have them already:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install Pillow tkinter requests opencv-python numpy imutils\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the script in a Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The GUI window will appear with the title \"Connection Window.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enter the URL of your IP webcam in the text entry field labeled \"Enter url.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Click the \"Enter\" button to start capturing images from the IP webcam.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The live stream from the IP webcam will be displayed in a window named \"Android_cam.\" You can press the \"c\" key to capture and save the current image. Captured images will be saved in the current directory with filenames like \"captured_image1.jpg,\" \"captured_image2.jpg,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To display a captured image, click the \"Display Image\" button. This will open a canvas displaying the last captured image. You can use the \"Next Image\" button to cycle through the captured images one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Press the \"Esc\" key to stop the live stream and display the \"Display Image\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your IP webcam is running and accessible via the provided URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Press \"c\" to capture and save images while the live stream is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the \"Display Image\" button to view the captured images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"Next Image\" button allows you to cycle through the captured images one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you encounter a connection timeout error, please check the URL of your IP webcam and ensure it's accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy using the IP Webcam Image Viewer!"
